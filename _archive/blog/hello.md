Hi there. Thanks to the recent Twitter meltdown and a current rebirth of many of the Internet-y things that were so exciting to me so many years ago (RSS, decentralized posting, online spaces where there aren't Nazis) I've re-booted the official levjoy.com Web Presence.

Welcome to it.

I have years of blog archives stored somewhere that I might put online someday. I don't think anyone cares about what I thought about sardines in 2009. Maybe they do. We'll see if I get to it.
