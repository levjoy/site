### The week in music

- The last week has been really hectic! Good, but hectic. Practicing with new bands (Outro and All Feels) to get ready for a show (Outro Friday night) and recording session (All Feels Saturday and Sunday).
- The Outro show was so great. All of our practicing paid off and we sounded tight and energetic, a lot of people showed up, I had family come, and the other bands were excellent. And all around great night.
- The All Feels [recording session](/blog/allfeels) went really, really well.

### Big picture

- Now it's time to wind down for a bit. I have come to understand that I can't maintain an adrenalized state for too long; it wears me out and other elements of my life suffer. So it's time to recalibrate and refocus. This includes a few nights away with friends and family next weekend.
- This means pressing pause on my work on the Outro record (I'll listen to mixes though...) and just focusing on work and family/

### Doing

- I put the [The City We Became](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_We_Became) aside. I was struggling with the tone and, frankly, the story. It didn't grab me and I had to stop struggling.
- I've picked back up Octavia Butler's [The Parable of the Talents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Talents_(novel)) which I had been meaning to read for years. It's dark but inviting and so human.
- I'm so absorbed in Meg Baird's record [Furling](https://megbaird.bandcamp.com/album/furling). It's the great folk rock album of the year.
