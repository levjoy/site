After an excellent, excellent show at the Drake in Amherst with [Outro](/posts/outro) on Friday night, I spent the weekend recording the first All Feels record at [1357 Recording Studio](https://www.1357recordingstudio.com). It was creative, comfortable, collaborative 48 hours and I'm so excited about what we made together.


All Feels is my friend Candace's band. It's kind of indie pop? Sometimes more driving than that, sometimes more synth-y. We've collaborated with a lot over the years, including in our band [Psychic Energy](https://psychicenergy.bandcamp.com), but this is a much more-realized project, with Will on bass and Jon on drums filling out the sound and all of us collectively bringing a lot of creative energy. Can't wait for it to reach the world.
