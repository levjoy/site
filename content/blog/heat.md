I tested positive for Covid a few days ago. Thankfully it's a *very* mild case, basically a middle-of-the-road cold. I have all my energy and my mind might be a slighy bit more cloudy than usual (hard to tell) but that's about it. The hardest and most frustrating part is that we have *five people* in this family and I need to stay away from all of them, which means long stretches of time in my room watching stuff on my laptop, which is definitely not typical for me. I've watched some random shit. 

I watched the Netflix series *(MH370: The Plane that Disappeared)[https://www.netflix.com/title/81307163]* about the disappearanced of a Malaysian Boing 777 a decade ago. I've since learned that Malaysians are deeply unhappy with the airtime the series gives to conspiracy theories as well as its attitude toward families of the passengers. I'm going to dig in and learn more.

Then, I watched Michael Mann's *Heat*. I had somehow never seen this film, which came out in 1995, when I was a freshman in college and wasn't watching a lot of movies in the theater. 

*Heat* is the archetype of the white, straight, male, violent crime fantasy. All the woman characters (with the possible exception of Natalie Portman) are two-dimensional plot points, more apparations of the male gaze than real characters. Ashley Judd doesn't act well, but she had almost no good material to work with. People of color are killed off quickly and we're asked to root for two fucked-up middle-aged white men. This is a movie of its time, back when Quentin Tarantino film posters graced every suburban white kid's bedroom walls. 

That said, the writing is smart, detailed, and technical, with almost no superfluous bits (except one scene, seemingly lifted straight from a late-night writer's room panicky "shit we better explain things for the viewer" session, in which Pacino details all of the movie's plot points over the phone). The noir vibe, complete with synth-y mood music, obviously comes straight from the mind of the dude who did Miami Vice. It's also insanely violent, with lots of shotgun blasts to the face. This is such a Michael Mann movie, especially knowing what he would do after (Insider, Collateral). 

It's interesting to think back on how this movie would have been seen and reacted to back in the mid-90s. Pacino and Deniro were in their 50s so were already "old," but they definitely still had some cachet and they're great here, mirror images as they eye, tail, and chase each other. 

To summarize: The filmmaking is great. Most of the acting was great. The writing is great. Thematically, it's embrassingly white and male (like most Hollywood movies circa 1995) and, in 2023, barely holds up.
